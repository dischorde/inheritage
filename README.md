## Background
The 1000 Genome Project ran over a span of 7 years and resulted in the creation of the largest public database of human genetic information. Our project makes this information accessible to everyone in a fun and easy to understand way by displaying genetic statistics based on their heritage on an interactive map. Inheritage will exclusively contain information on Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP), a common variance between different ethnicities.

This project incorporates a Python backend with Django framework and a React.js frontend.

Please see the [docs][docs] folder for more information on the development of this project.

## Features and Implementation

### Personal Profiles

### Ethnicities and Subpopulations

### SNPs

## Future Directions
- We plan to allow the user to create an account so that they are able to see their profile the next time they log in.
- We also plan to create a SNP index, so that the user can view all the SNPs on one page.
